[py-kms](https://github.com/Py-KMS-Organization/py-kms) is a port of node-kms created by cyrozap, which is a port of either the C#, C++, or .NET implementations of KMS Emulator. The original version was written by CODYQX4 and is derived from the reverse-engineered code of Microsoft's official KMS. This version of py-kms is itself a fork of the original implementation by SystemRage, which was abandoned early 2021.

These are my own builds of the Minimal image using the [LSIO base](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-alpine) and s6 because the upstream project keeps accepting PRs for the entrypoint scripts that change their behaviour in ways that break the container.

## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures.

Simply pulling `ghcr.io/thespad/py-kms:latest` should retrieve the correct image for your arch.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Available | Tag |
| :----: | :----: | ---- |
| x86-64 | ✅ | latest |
| arm64 | ✅ | latest |

## Application Setup

More info at [py-kms](https://github.com/Py-KMS-Organization/py-kms).

## Read-Only Operation

This image can be run with a read-only container filesystem.

Running the container read-only requires mounting `/run` to tmpfs with the `exec` flag.

## Non-Root Operation

This image can be run with a non-root user.

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker-compose ([recommended](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose))

```yaml
---
services:
  py-kms:
    image: ghcr.io/thespad/py-kms:latest
    container_name: py-kms
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - IP=0.0.0.0 #optional
    volumes:
      - /path/to/py-kms/config:/config
    ports:
      - 1688:1688
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### docker cli

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name=py-kms \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e IP=0.0.0.0 `#optional` \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -p 1688:1688 \
  -v /path/to/py-kms/config:/config \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/thespad/py-kms:latest
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 1688` | KMS Port |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London |
| `-e IP=` | IP address to bind to. Use `0.0.0.0` for all IPv4 interfaces, use `::` for all IPv6 interfaces, or specify a full address. Note that for compose you must quote the full variable, e.g. `- "IP=0.0.0.0"` or `- "IP=::"`. |
| `-v /config` | Contains all relevant configuration files. |

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```shell
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it py-kms /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f py-kms`

## Updating Info

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. We do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Please consult the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section above to see if it is recommended for the image.

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull py-kms`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d py-kms`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image: `docker pull ghcr.io/thespad/py-kms`
* Stop the running container: `docker stop py-kms`
* Delete the container: `docker rm py-kms`
* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Image Update Notifications - Diun (Docker Image Update Notifier)

>[!TIP]
>We recommend [Diun](https://crazymax.dev/diun/) for update notifications. Other tools that automatically update containers unattended are not recommended or supported.

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/thespad/docker-py-kms.git
cd docker-py-kms
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t ghcr.io/thespad/py-kms:latest .
```

The arm variants can be built on x86_64 hardware and vice versa using `lscr.io/linuxserver/qemu-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged lscr.io/linuxserver/qemu-static --reset
```
